.SYNOPSIS
    Runs the SAR app locally against the real deployed workspace.
.DESCRIPTION
    Wraps `databricks apps run-local` per docs/sar-app.md's "Local development"
    section:
      - resolves the workspace's platform SQL warehouse ID from Terraform
        outputs, rather than hardcoding it, so this script keeps working
        across destroy/apply cycles (each cycle gets a new workspace/warehouse)
      - starts that warehouse if it's stopped - a stopped warehouse's cold
        start isn't reliably handled by the SQL connector's own request
        timeout, so searching while it's still starting fails with a bare
        `databricks.sql.exc.RequestError`
      - looks up the deployed lineage_cache_refresh job's numeric ID (not in
        Terraform outputs — it's a Databricks Asset Bundle resource, and
        `bundle summary` doesn't expose job IDs directly, so this greps
        `databricks jobs list` by name instead) and passes it as
        LINEAGE_CACHE_REFRESH_JOB_ID, since app.yaml's `valueFrom` binding
        for it only resolves inside a deployed app, same as the warehouse ID
      - fetches a fresh OAuth token (tokens last about an hour; a
        long-running `run-local` process keeps using the token it launched
        with, so restart via this script rather than reusing an old window)
      - launches the app

    Requires a one-time `databricks auth login --host <workspace-host> -p <Profile>`
    before first use, and again whenever the cached token is invalid (check
    with `databricks auth profiles`).
.PARAMETER Profile
    The ~/.databrickscfg profile name for the deployed workspace.
.PARAMETER InstallDeps
    Also run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first (skipped by default -
    only needed once, or after requirements.txt changes).
